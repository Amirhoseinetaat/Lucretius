# Lucretius

Lucretius is a fully decentralized metaverse web-based game that is filled with endless fun and adventure. It is an exciting new complex where you can connect with other users, make new friends, participate in community events, win contests, exchange NFTs at the marketplace, and many other fun activities.
In Lucretius, the fun never ends. You can participate in auction events, art exhibitions, concerts and even get paid for having fun with Play & Earn. It is a web-based game that stands out because it offers the best of two worlds. It provides an exhilarating gameplay experience and a platform for players who want to acquire and trade NFTs, even if they have no idea what an NFT is.
Lucretius was not created as a game for only blockchain players. It is aimed at a segment of the gaming community which can be quickly onboarded from other mainstream platforms. Our unique angle offers an exciting way to connect a compelling game narrative with the metaverse and underlying blockchain technology.
With these features, the Lucretius complex can attract millions of gamers to the blockchain ecosystem and create multiple income generation streams in the process. The project leverages the XRPL, which facilitates advanced and in-game DeFi features.

The Lucretius project is an exciting new metaverse with lots of unique features. In addition to a compelling plot, the game is loaded with lots of activities for players to engage in. an example of these fantastic features is the in-game cross-chain NFT marketplace that allows players to trade their NFTs across various blockchain networks. The game is heavily incentivized, and as such, active and dedicated players will be rewarded with points and LUC tokens.  

The LUC token is the native currency of the Lucretius complex, and it's the only accepted means of payment. Players can use their LUC tokens to acquire NFTs and other in-game assets within the Lucretius complex.  

The game is built on the ultra-efficient XRPL ledger and provides the player with an incredibly immersive gameplay experience. The interface is visually appealing and extremely easy to navigate, making it an enjoyable game to play anytime, any day.

# Key Game Features
## Key Features
The Lucretius complex is loaded with many features that make it fun, interactive, and easy to navigate. It is divided into three core areas highlighted below:

### The playing area:
You can join other players and play different games like billiards, bowling, and poker. More games will be added in the future versions of the game. Some include a kids' playground, a rally racetrack, adventure games and an entire golf course outside the complex.

### The communication area:
It is where you will find the communication, trade, and auction hall. Here, all players can truly interact and connect. You can trade your avatars items or other in-game assets with other players. The gallery also allows creators to launch auctions, presale events and giveaways for their products.

### The clubbing/concert/conference area:
This multipurpose area can be used for all kinds of social activities. Players can rent this area for various activities, including clubbing, conferences, AMA sessions, etc. Big DJs, record producers, and music artists can rent the space for concerts and sell tickets right there in the complex.

### The middle area:
In the first version of the game, the middle of the complex has 27 shops that players and other users can buy and use to display their products. 24 of these shops are on the first floor while the remaining 3 are on the second floor. These shops are minted as NFTs so there will be 27 tokens for all the shops. The owner of the token owns the shop and has full authority to rent it out or sell or use for its products. Players and other users will be able to see the all details concerning the shops and their owners. There is a details section at the bottom that users can click to see the link to their website and al their social media pages.

__NB:__ 3 of the 24 shops available in the Lucretius have been reserved by the Moon Light Night platform.

### The second floor:
The complex's second floor is where the hall is. It is a large hall that will serve as the gallery by default. The walls are covered with exquisite artwork, and everyone can see information about the artist by clicking on them. All MLN verified artists have the right to showcase their artworks here and put the link of their collection in the marketplace. It has limitation for artists that will be announced at launch. The hall will also be used to host exhibition events. The creator will be in charge of running the exhibition.

## Other Features
__Other essential parts of the game include:__

__Avatar:__ Every player will be represented in the game with an avatar. Your avatar is what you will use to interact with other players. You can change your avatar's appearance by adding different assets to it. Project creators can order their NFT avatars to add it in the game. The price of order will depend on the time of order.

__In-game assets:__ Items that can be bought within the complex and deployed. Some in- game purchases include avatars, shops, concert tickets, artworks from the gallery/exhibition hall, and so on. These assets are minted as NFTs and players can trade them with each other inside the Lucretius complex. However, some assets (like concert tickets) come with an expiry date and cannot be used outside of the complex.

__Reputation system:__ The game will also feature a reputation system that rewards active players with exclusive benefits based on their level of participation/activity. For example, we implement a three-tier reputation system where players can upgrade their status by being active in the complex and interacting with other players.

__Shared quests and community events:__ The primary purpose of the Lucretius complex is to create an atmosphere that will develop a sense of community among all players. The complex will make it possible for players to come together and organize community events.

## Coming Soon
__Other exciting features coming in future versions of the game include:__

__In-game cross-chain marketplace:__ The NFT marketplace will play a chief part of the Lucretius experience. The marketplace will be based on the XRPL ledger and will grant players immutable ownership of the assets they purchase in it. We expect it to be a central hub of activity where players flock to as a part of their Lucretius experience. Players can sell their NFTs across different blockchain networks like XRPL, Ethereum, and Solana.

__More games added to the complex:__ Many more games will be added to the complex to add variety to its offering. Games like rally racing, golf and other adventure/mystery games will be added. As such, we will build an entire golf course, a rally racetrack, and a kids' playground outside the complex. In the same vein, the town around the complex will develop with more shops around each game.
